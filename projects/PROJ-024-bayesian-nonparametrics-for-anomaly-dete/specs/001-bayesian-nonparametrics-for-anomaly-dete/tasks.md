# Tasks: Bayesian Nonparametrics for Anomaly Detection in Time Series

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-bayesian-nonparametrics-anomaly-detection/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
**Branch**: `001-bayesian-nonparametrics-anomaly-detection`
**Tests**: Tests are REQUIRED per spec.md Independent Test scenarios for all user stories.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 0: Research & Design Documentation (Blocking)

**Purpose**: Create required design artifacts that plan.md designates as Phase 0/1 outputs

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: These artifacts must be created before Phase 1 Setup begins

- [X] T012 Create `state/projects/PROJ-024-bayesian-nonparametrics-for-anomaly-dete.yaml` for artifact hashes AND implement checksum recording logic for all state artifacts per Constitution Principle III in `projects/PROJ-024-bayesian-nonparametrics-for-anomaly-dete/state/projects/PROJ-024-bayesian-nonparametrics-for-anomaly-dete.yaml` <!-- FAILED-IN-EXECUTION: code/scripts/update_state_checksums.py exit=1 -->

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 0 (Research & Design)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Setup (Phase 1)**: Depends on Phase 0 completion
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete
- **Review Revisions (Phase 7)**: Depends on Phase 6 completion - BLOCKS final acceptance

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (REQUIRED) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members
- Phase 7 revision tasks can be executed in parallel where file conflicts do not exist

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Contract test for DPGMM model output schema in tests/contract/test_dp_gmm_schema.py"
Task: "Integration test for streaming observation update in tests/integration/test_streaming_update.py"
Task: "Memory usage test verifying <7GB RAM limit in tests/unit/test_memory_profile.py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create DPGMMModel class with stick-breaking construction in models/dp_gmm.py"
Task: "Create AnomalyScore dataclass in models/anomaly_score.py"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 0: Research & Design Documentation
2. Complete Phase 1: Setup
3. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
4. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Phase 0 + Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Phase 0 + Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Developer D (or team rotation): Phase 7 review-driven revisions

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Tests are REQUIRED per spec.md Independent Test scenarios (not OPTIONAL)
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- Dataset URLs must be real and reachable (UCI Machine Learning Repository, NAB CSVs at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/numenta/NAB/master/data/realKnownCause/...)
- Task ordering MUST respect data flow: download datasets (T008, T037-T039) BEFORE model training (T016-T026), model training BEFORE evaluation (T031-T041)
- Note: `contracts/` under `specs/` contains schema definitions; `tests/contract/` contains pytest validation tests against those schemas
- PEMS-SF is from PEMS project NOT UCI Machine Learning Repository - use UCI Synthetic Control Chart or ECG Five Groups instead
- **Phase 7 tasks are CRITICAL and must be completed before final acceptance per research-stage review requirements**
- All execution failure tasks (T030, T037, T041, T057, T062-T083) must be resolved and marked [X] before project can transition to analyzed stage
- Structure deviation (code/src/ vs projects/.../code/) must be corrected per Constitution Principle V
- config.yaml must be under 2KB per T073 requirement
- All datasets must have proper provenance documentation per T067
- Modern baseline (LSTM-AE) must be added per creativity review T090-T092
- Type hints and mypy CI must be implemented per T071-T072
- All test infrastructure must be verified per T074-T077
- Repository hygiene (.gitignore, pinned requirements) must be addressed per T084-T085
